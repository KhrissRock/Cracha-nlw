### 💻 Goal
 
 Create a virtual badge that can be changed by changing the data in the LinksSocialMedia object located in main.js, in this the main attribute is github, as this will be sent as a parameter to request from the GitHub api the data such as name, login and image of profile. The other attributes must be filled in according to the respective social networks.


### 🛠 Technologies

### 🎲 Running the Back End (server)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/khrissrock/cracha-nlw>

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd cracha-nlw

# To access VScode directly from the terminal/cmd or you can access it manually from your device
$ code

# In vscode, select the option open folder and find the directory cracha-nlw

# Find yourself and open the index.html file with your browser or, if you have installed the VScode LiveServer extension, open it with LiveServer

```
